(ns fukan.canvas.vocab.event
  "Methodology vocabulary for event-driven systems.
   Opt-in: require this namespace only if your project models named events
   and reactive handlers explicitly.

   ## Motivation

   Emerged from Phase 4 Sprint 3 stress-test against an event-driven
   e-commerce paradigm (5 modules: cart, order, payment, shipping,
   notification). The rule-of-three threshold was reached by:
     - `event` lift:   10 instances across 4 modules (cart×3, order×1,
                        payment×3, shipping×3)
     - `handler` lift: 6 instances across 4 modules (order×1, payment×1,
                        shipping×1, notification×3)

   ## Lifts

   `event` — declares a named event with a payload shape. Semantically
   distinct from `record` (events are messages, not data structures).
   Produces a no-shape Affordance with role `:canvas/event` plus a
   sibling :event/payload attribute holding the payload shape.

   `handler` — declares a function that reacts to an event. Produces an
   Affordance with role `:canvas/handler`. The `on` form names the event
   being handled (a keyword reference); the `emits` form (repeatable)
   declares which events this handler can fire next.

   ## What was NOT shipped (rule-of-three evidence)

   `topic` — 0 instances observed. The stress-test modules used direct
   handler coupling, not named channels. Deferred.

   `emits` as standalone lift — the emits semantic recurs but is naturally
   a form within `handler` (and within `function` via the existing `effect`
   form). No case for a standalone lift."

(defconstructor event
  "A named event declaration with an optional payload shape.
   Events are messages, not data structures — semantically distinct from
   `record` even when they carry fields.

   Example:
     (event \"ItemAdded\"
       \"An item was added to the cart.\"
       (payload [item_id :String] [qty :Integer]))

   The `payload` form takes field pairs like `takes` in `function`."

(defconstructor handler
  "A reactive handler that fires when a named event arrives.
   Semantically distinct from `function`: handlers are invoked by the
   event bus, not by direct call.

   Example:
     (handler \"handle_cart_checked_out\"
       \"Place an order when a cart is checked out.\"
       (on :cart/CartCheckedOut)
       (emits :order/OrderPlaced))
