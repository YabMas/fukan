(ns canvas.descent.source
  "DESCENT STEP — the `Source` in-fold, descended with TEETH (the first generative-descent slice).
   `canvas.subject/Source` is a pure portrait: it declares a `:polarity [:enum \"design-down\"
   \"code-up\"]` in-fold but asserts no law, so nothing forces its realization to cover both
   flavours. This spec adds the missing pressure: a realization edge (`SourceRealizer` names the
   `Module` that realizes one polarity) plus a structural-witness LAW the descent must satisfy.

   The same law reads three ways: DOWN = verify (it runs in `check`), UP = carve and GAP = prompt
   (those readings live in `fukan.descent`). It joins to the reflected `Source` by its tag — the
   same mechanism the module roles use — so NO kernel structure-reference slot is lifted. This is the
   model↔realization correspondence for the in-fold, so it lives in its own seam (like
   `fukan.target.correspondence`), NOT on the pure `Source` portrait (which must not name
   realizers). The Source role now sits on the realizing Modules (`:realizes subj/Source`); this is its toothed
   companion."
