(ns canvas.correspondence
  "The model↔code correspondence SEAM — kept OFF the domain. Code is a projection of the model, so
   the model must not reference what realizes it; the dependency runs the other way. This is the
   verify-DOWN link of the tower (Subject → Realization → Code): a `SubjectRealization` carries both
   endpoints (a subject concept and the code Module(s) that build it), so the pure subject domain
   never names its realizers.

   A realization also records the concept's DATA FORM when it has one — the code `Kind` that IS the
   concept's shape (`:form`), a facet of the same realization since the realizing module owns it.
   That data-shape correspondence is checked; the flow→signature half is harder and stays deferred."

(defstructure SubjectRealization
  "Seam (verify-DOWN): the realization of a subject (design) concept — Layer 1 → Layer 2. The link
   lives HERE, on a dedicated node, precisely so it is element-AGNOSTIC: it names the realizing code
   element(s) in `:by` — a `Module` today; an `Operation`, a `Kind`, or any code element we invent
   tomorrow, with ZERO change to those structures — and the concept's data shape in `:form` (the
   `Kind` that IS it, when it has one; a facet of the realization, since the realizer owns it:
   Model→StructureDb, focus→Finding, project→Instruction). Embedding `:realizes` on `Module` would
   force the same slot onto `Operation`, `Kind`, … in turn; reifying the relation expresses 'code
   realizes design' ONCE, for any code element. Authored off the pure domain (code is a projection
   of the model). Crosses subject→code; distinct from the domain `Correspondence` (extract ⊣
   project, a within-subject relation).

   NB named `SubjectRealization`, not `Realization`: `fukan.target.correspondence/Realization` is
   the op-layer law-host. Distinct namespaces keep both, but the names stay descriptive."

   checked against real `src/` functions by the op-layer correspondence — so this reaches the code
   transitively.)

   The use-side `Lens`/`Projection` share short names with the lower-altitude `canvas.vocabulary.act`
