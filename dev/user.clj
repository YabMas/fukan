  "Development helpers for REPL-driven workflow.

   The HTTP server + web explorer are PAUSED during the lean-kernel rebuild
   (parked under .paused/), so the server-lifecycle helpers are gone. The
   kernel feedback loop is now: build a store with `with-canvas`, query it
   with `d/q`, run constraints — all in-process. `refresh` reloads code and
   rebuilds the held model; `status` reports the model."
